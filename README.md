# Building-data-pipeline-using-Apache-Airflow

This project is carried out in a Coursera Course [ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka]. In this project, I collect data from different file formats and consolidate into single file
- CSV
- TSV
- Fixed Width File

I developed the data pipeline using Apache Airflow.
